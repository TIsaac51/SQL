/* This is my a project where I answered sample questions using a databases called Chinook containing the following tables: 
 
 employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
 customers table stores customers data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
 The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
 artists table stores artists data.
 albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.
 media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
 genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
 tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
 playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship. *?
